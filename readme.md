## IMPORTANT: Course Evaluations

Link: [www.qc.cuny.edu/evaluate](https://www.qc.cuny.edu/evaluate)

It's that time of the season again: course evaluations. Please take a few minutes to fill them out for all your courses. They don't take much time to complete, and they are extremely helpful to the professors teaching the courses, letting them know what the students think about the course, and what to change/keep the same for the next term. Course evaluations are **fully anonymous** so you don't have to worry about the professor failing you for giving them a bad evaluation.
